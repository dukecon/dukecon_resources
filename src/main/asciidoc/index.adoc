This project contains

* DukeCon (configuration) resources, in particular `conferences.yml` (or the fragments which are composed to a suitable DukeCon conference configuration),
* Static DukeCon conference data (conference archive),
* Some code/Docker configuration to provide a DukeCon conference archive/cache service for current and legacy conferences.

[NOTE]
====
Currently the data in the Docker image is stored and provided statically.
In the future the service might be extended by a caching proxy to improve access to remote (slow) conference data of active conferences.
====

== Motivation

The project contributes to the widespread single source principle of IT artifacts management. It should be possible to

* create new artifacts out of the existing ones,
* directly install the given or the composed artifacts to target systems,
* deploy the artifacts into suitable repositories (e.g., Maven oder Docker),
* provide live data (eg. http://archive.dukecon.org) of current and legacy conference program contents.

== Contents

Currently the project only contains misc. fragments of DukeCon `conference.yml` configuration files, e.g.,

[source,yaml]
.DukeCon JavaLand conference configuration (extract)
----
include::../conference-fragments/conferences-javaland-2020.yml[lines=1..15]
...
----

These source fragments are stored in the link:src/main/conference-fragments[] folder of the project.

Additionally it contains some _archived_ content of older conferences in link:src/main/data[].

[CAUTION]
.Legacy Conference Data
[[caution:legacy-code]]
====
The code in some other DukeCon projects (https://github.com/dukecon/dukecon_pwa.git[DukeCon Web UI] and https://github.com/dukecon/dukecon_server.git[DukeCon Server]) which was used to provide the misc. conference program web sites from the data has undergone several refactorings.
During this course the team did not always keep the code working for outdated conferences.
Hence, we still have some older data but the server and UI code might not be able to process this data.

== Usage

All actions can be performed by the included Maven Wrapper (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows), or by your local Maven or IDE-based Maven.

The following usage types are provided:

* <<sec:conference-composition>>
* <<sec:docker-composition>>

[[sec:conference-composition]]
=== Composition of conference configurations

The sources are composed to new artifacts during the Maven _process-resources_ phase and will be generated to the
link:target/classes[] folder:

  mvnw process-resources

==== Composed files

The default build creates a number of compositions for different DukeCon conferences (files will be located in link:target/classes[]):

The following file(s) is/are composed:

link:target/classes/conferences.yml[`conferences.yml`]::
The composition of this file depends on a Maven profile (cf. <<sec:maven-profiles>>).
The profile can be selected manually or it is selected automatically depending on, e.g., the hostname of the generating host.
It is a collection of all suitable conferences (e.g. all public conferences);

link:target/classes/conferences-javaland.yml[`conferences-javaland.yml`]::
  The http://programm.javaland.eu[Javaland conferences];

link:target/classes/conferences-doag.yml[`conferences-doag.yml`]::
  The http://programm.doag.org[DOAG conferences];

link:target/classes/conferences-ijug+doag.yml[`conferences-ijug+doag.yml`]::
  All conferences provides by http://doag.org[DOAG] and http://ijug.eu[iJUG] (currently http://programm.javaland.eu[Javaland] + Java Forum Stuttgart);

link:target/classes/conferences-stable.yml[`conferences-stable.yml`]::
  All conferences which are backed by a stable code base (currently DOAG, Javaland + https://apachecon.dukecon.org[ApacheCon], as opposed to the legacy conferences, cf. <<caution:legacy-code>>).

[[sec:maven-profiles]]
==== Maven profiles

The following Maven profiles can be used to generate particular fragments which are combined to the final file(s)

`generate-current-ijug+doag` (automatically selected on host `dukecon0`):: Used to generate a conferences file containing configurations for all conferences with
publicly available data sources (e.g. Javaland and DOAG conferences).

`generate-all-public`:: Used to generate a conferences file containing configurations for all conferences with
publicly available data sources (e.g. Javaland and DOAG conferences).

`generate-apachecon` (automatically selected on host `apachecon0`):: Generate conference configuration for ApacheCon (_hint_: This will only work if you have the
non-publicly available conference configuration fragment for ApacheCon present locally).

[[sec:docker-composition]]
=== Docker Composition

In general, provisioning and consumption of conference data in development, test and production

* needs a lot of computation efforts on the data provider side (Most of the conference data of current conferences is computed on the fly from other sources);
* requires network bandwidth for both, provider and consumer (in particular for speaker data with images etc.);
* leads to some latency and the risk of network or resource outages.

NOTE: Suppose you are a DukeCon developer and do not want to consume large amounts of downloading data when performing some tests.

To circumvent or reduce these restrictions a Docker image can be created from the fragments and the computed compositions (and the referenced conference data).
Depending on the composed fragments the data of the respective conferences are fetched from their original sites and can be packed into the Docker image (cf. <<sec:docker-build>>.
The archived data (from link:src/main/data[]) will also be put into the image.
The Docker image can be started

* as a service on the internet (a current instance is http://archive.dukecon.org[] site),
* or locally (cf. <<sec:docker-run>>).

There are several usage scenarios for such an active data source:

* The site http://archive.dukecon.org[] provides a stable state of some legacy and current conferences (Use http://archive.dukecon.org/cgi-bin/conferences.cgi[]).
  ** It can (and will) be used to provide access to older conference data which is no longer provided by the conference organisation;
  ** It can be used for larger testing on the test infrastructure.
* Developers and testers can run a local version (either pulled from Docker Hub or built locally).
  ** If desired they can even work offline;
  ** They can provide particular subsets for their developer tests if necessary;
  ** They can manipulate data for local tests
  ** etc.

==== Docker Pull

A current version can be found on https://hub.docker.com/r/dukecon/dukecon-resources[Docker Hub].

It can be pulled by

  docker pull dukecon/dukecon-resources

[[sec:docker-build]]
==== Docker Build

A local build can be performed with Maven by activating the `docker` profile

  mvnw clean verify -Pdocker

By selecting a particular second Maven profile the downloaded conference data can be reduced or completely omitted (by restricting the image contents to local/archived data).

[[sec:docker-run]]
==== Docker Run

Once the local image is either pulled or built, a container may be started

  docker run --rm -p 42080:80 --name dukecon-resources dukecon/dukecon-resources

The embedded Apache httpd is exposed via the given Port (`42080`) and provides all stored data via the links in the conferences resource:
http://localhost:42080/cgi-bin/conferences.cgi[].

This URL can be directly given to the DukeCon server application:

  java -jar .../dukecon-server.war \
      ... \
      --conferences.file=http://localhost:42080/cgi-bin/conferences.cgi

to make it fetch all data from the local archive service instead of from the Internet.

== Maven Packaging and Install / Deploy (Deprecated)

WARNING: This is currently not recommended since the contents of the generated JAR is dependant on the chosen Maven
profile.

The resources are packed into a Maven artifact JAR by

  mvnw package

which creates a `.jar` with the respective Maven project version number in the link:target[] folder.

This file can be installed to the local Maven repository (`$HOME/.m2/repository`)

  mvnw install

or deployed to the configured Maven remote repository

  mvnw deploy

The latter step will be performed automatically by
https://dev.dukecon.org/jenkins/blue/organizations/jenkins/dukecon_resources/activity[Jenkins].

== Local installation

With Maven profiles allow to perform local installations on test and production systems, e.g.,

  mvnw install -Pinstall-testing-docker

which will copy the created `conferences.yml` to `/data/dukecon/testing/server/config`

Currently the following profiles with their respective targets are available

[%header,cols=2*]
.Maven Profiles and Target directories
|===
| Profile | Target
| `install-latest-docker` | `/data/dukecon/latest/server/config`
| `install-testing-docker` | `/data/dukecon/testing/server/config`
| `install-doag-production-docker` | `/data/dukecon/doag-production/server/config`
